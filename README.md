#Individual Assignment 2

The project consists of a Particle Photon, Proximity sensor as an input and a Neo pixel LED ring as an output. 
The photon takes the values from the proximity sensor and sends it to the cloud using particle.variable function. 
Using JavaScript and particle.function the values are pulled from the cloud and displayed on the webpage. 
The visualization of the sensor data consists of displaying the Integer values and also visualizing it using paper.js framework.

As the proximity sensor senses something/somebody is close to it, it gives the equivalent output on the Neo pixel ring as well as on the web page.
